title: Tips for Technical Presentions
---

Over the years, I've noticed that people tend to misuse Powerpoint. I was one
of these people, until I started researching what separates a highly
effective PowerPoint presentation from the rest. I've compiled my 
findings in this post.

### Why most PowerPoints are ineffective

The majority of PowerPoint presentations are ineffective for one of two reasons:
1. **Mistake #1** - PowerPoint is used when it is not necessary
2. **Mistake #2** - PowerPoint slides are poorly formatted

This means you can instantly become better at PowerPoint simply by interrogating whether or 
not a PowerPoint presentation is necessary at all. As you do this, here are some 
helpful heuristics to keep in mind:
* PowerPoint is **not** a good tool for facilitating meetings. Instead, consider
distributing a Google Doc with an agenda or memo for attendees to read beforehand
* PowerPoint is **not** a good medium for providing supplementary notes to an 
audience. Instead, put supplementary information in a separate memo that you can
distribute after your presentation
* PowerPoint should **not** be used as a script or outline for the presenter. Instead, 
your slides should be designed to enhance an audience's comprehension

### How to format your PowerPoint slides

According to a team of public speaking experts at Penn State, people are prone 
to crafting poorly formatted PowerPoint slides because 
["PowerPoint defaults are weak."](https://vimeo.com/385725081) 
In short, PowerPoint defaults encourage presenters to collapse their ideas
into bullet points, which leads to text-heavy slides that are cluttered, 
disorganized, and antithetical to audience comprehension.  

To combat this problem, the same team at Penn State created the [Assertion
Evidence Model](https://www.assertion-evidence.com/) to encourage presenters to 
create talks that "are comprehended better by audiences and project more 
confidence from speakers."

### The Three Principles of the Assertion Evidence Model

The key to the success of the Assertion Evidence Model is the constraints it
imposes on PowerPoint presentations - also known as the [Principles of 
Assertion Evidence](https://www.assertion-evidence.com/principles.html):

1. **Principle #1** - You must break away from the PowerPoint mold. This means
that instead of constructing each slide around a topic, each slide should be 
focused around a key message. This will be your “assertion.” Messages should 
be developed outside of PowerPoint and you should only move to 
PowerPoint once you’ve established what each slide's message will be. 
2. **Principle #2** - Support each slide’s assertion with visual evidence (not bullet points). 
3. **Principle #3** - Get comfortable with your content through practice so that 
you project confidence during your presentation. DO NOT memorize a script. 
Rather, know the content well enough so that you can form off-the-cuff sentences 
to support each slide’s assertion. 

### How to use the Assertion Evidence Model

The Assertion Evdience team has a helpful [website](https://www.assertion-evidence.com/) 
that includes [improved PowerPoint templates](https://www.assertion-evidence.com/templates.html) 
to get you started. However, it's important to note that the Assertion Evidence 
templates alone will not make a great presentation. In order to give a great 
presentation, you must have sufficient motivation to prepare your ideas and
craft intuitive slides.

### In Summary

Too many people fail to question the need for PowerPoint and
meetings more generally. Get into the habit using meetings and PowerPoint as
sparingly as possible. If you find yourself in a change-resistant culture 
where meetings and PowerPoint are overvalued, leave as quickly as possible.  

When you must use PowerPoint, get familiar with the Assertion Evidence Model 
and consider using it for your presentation. And remember that you and your ideas
are the heart of your presentations - not your slides.
