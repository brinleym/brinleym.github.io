title: My Experience on the Carnivore Diet
---

**Skin**

My acne is gone. It is nice to not have acne on my face all the time. 

**Hair**

My hair grows really fast (1 inch per month)!

**Digestion**

My digestion is easy and predictable. I‚Äôm free of digestive issues. Cheat meals tend to lead to quick recurrences of my digestive issues. Fiber is a menace to my body, so I avoid fiber altogether. 

**Joint + Back Pain**

90% of my joint pain is gone. On the ‚Äúlion‚Äù diet (ruminant meat + salt only), it is 99% gone. 

My joint pain increases when I ‚Äúrelax‚Äù the diet by incorporating diary or the occasional carb, so I try my best to avoid dairy and cheat meals. 

**Headaches**

When I first started the carnivore diet, I got severe sinus headaches. I realized this was a symptom of carbohydrate withdrawal (a common issue for new carnivores). I tried adding more salt to my meals, which decreased my headaches, but this was not a cure. Weekly migraine infusions were more effective, but ultimately, my headaches persisted and I really just had to tough them out until my body was adequately fat adapted.

**Eating Out**

I‚Äôve given up on eating out because restaurant food always causes issues for me. I‚Äôve accepted my predicament and have found a great deal of comfort in home cooked meals. 

**Traveling**

Traveling is super hard on the carnivore diet. I try my best to pack carnivore friendly snacks. If I run out of snacks or need variety, I will go to a local burger joint and order 6-10 meat patties (with salt). 

**Hygiene**

Overall, I feel less dirty on a carnivore diet. I don‚Äôt need to shower everyday and even when I do shower, I only do a light rinse‚Ä¶I rarely have to wash my hair or scrub my body. 

**Fighting Cravings**

I‚Äôve learned the best way to fight cravings is to not be hungry. I prioritize eating a big breakfast and I always bring several carnivore snacks with me to work. I do not fast, since fasting is controversial and often leads to carb binges/cheat meals.

**General Findings**

- ‚ÄúBorderline‚Äù foods like yogurt, cheese, milk, and honey ruin my results. Some carnivores can tolerate dairy and honey, but I‚Äôm extremely sensitive to these foods and avoid them as much as possible.
- At the beginning of my carnivore diet, I put too much pressure on myself to have a lot of variety in my meals. This quickly led to burnout as carnivore substitutes for carbs can be somewhat complex. Now, I eat the same thing every day and am fine with it üôÇ.
- I do better on a ‚Äúhigh fat‚Äù carnivore diet where 50% of my calories come from fat and the other 50% come from protein. Others do better on a ‚Äúhigh protein‚Äù carnivore diet. The right breakdown of protein and fat will depend on the individual and it can take some trial and error to figure this out.

**Long Term Maintenance**

Carnivore is a strict diet that is difficult to maintain long term. In the near future, I plan to start reintroducing healthy, whole carbs such as berries, organic potatoes, and maple syrup. Having said that, I will continue to eat an animal based diet that is full of protein and healthy fats. While I may not
be a die hard carnivore, I am very much a die hard animal eater.
